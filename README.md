# Animal and Plant Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying animals and plants into their respective categories using deep learning techniques. The project uses a pretrained model (ResNet) to classify 90 animal species and 40 plant species based on images.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on using deep learning techniques to classify images into two main categories:
- **Animals**: 90 species, with around 60 images per species.
- **Plants**: 40 species, with around 1000 images per species.

We use a pretrained ResNet model for transfer learning and fine-tune it on the specific dataset. The model is capable of classifying images with high accuracy, and it can be further improved with more training and hyperparameter tuning.


## Model

We use a **ResNet** model, pretrained on ImageNet, for this classification task. Transfer learning is employed by fine-tuning the model's last few layers for our specific dataset.

### Steps Involved:
1. Load the pretrained ResNet model.
2. Freeze the initial layers and train the last few layers with the dataset.
3. Apply image augmentation and normalization to improve the modelâ€™s generalization.
4. Train the model using an appropriate optimizer and loss function.
5. Evaluate the model on a test set.
